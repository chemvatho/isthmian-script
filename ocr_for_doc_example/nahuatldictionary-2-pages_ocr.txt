retains its basic shape or changes in a way common to all stems with comparable
shape and takes prefixes and suffixes as described in any Nahuatl reference gram-
mar. If the inflection is unpredictable from the canonical form or irregular, and if
the sources for this dictionary provide examples of the inflection, then this in-
formation is given here, immediately following the canonical form of the word.
Typically this will involve plural and possessive forms of nouns and preterit forms
of verbs. If alternative forms of these are attested, the variants are given separated
by a wavy line. If a regular phonological process is reflected orthographically, then
it is given here even if it is predictable. For instance, the preterit form of NEM(I} ‘to
live’ is NEN. The change of M to N is regular and predictable, but the preterit form
is given as a reminder to the dictionary user.

In the case of long words, when grammatical information concerns only the end,
the whole word is not reproduced, but instead there is abbreviation to the last
element, with a hyphen indicating that the preceding material remains unchanged.

The grammatical section also indicates part of speech, such as postposition, par-
ticle, exclamation, etc. If an entry is not specifically identified, the less-is-more
principle is at work, and the part of speech is obvious from the gloss.

Transitive verbs are those that require a direct object; intransitive ones do not
take a direct object. An example of an English transitive verb is eat in the sentence
‘He ate the food,’ while sing is intransitive in ‘She sang beautifully.’ English, how-
ever, allows some latitude in transitivity, as illustrated by ‘He eats at noon every
day’ and ‘She sang the song.’ On the other hand, Nahuatl strictly distinguishes
transitive from intransitive verbs, and for that reason the transitive ones are labeled
here. Generally speaking, transitive verbs may be used reflexively, in which case
one performs some action upon oneself or to one’s own benefit or causes oneself to
engage in some activity. But not all transitive verbs are in fact so used, and there
are a few verbs in Nahuatl! which have come to be used exclusively reflexively. For
this reason, verbs are labeled not only transitive but also reflexive if that use is
attested. Here a convention established by Molina is observed, and the reflexive use
is indicated before the transitive use, even though the former is a special case of the

latter. By the less-is-more principle a verb not labeled reflexive and/or transitive is
intransitive.

ENGLISH GLOSS

The aim of the English gloss is to convey the basic meaning of the word.

This has sometimes resulted in an English gloss more literal than the following
Spanish one, so the two should be taken together, the Spanish gloss amplifying the
English one.

If a word has more than one meaning, and they are at some distance from each
other semantically, the different senses are given separated by a semicolon. On the
other hand, there are some completely different words that happen to be homopho-
nous (that is, to have identical canonical forms}, and in these cases there are sepa-
rate main entries.

Another use of the semicolon in the English gloss is with transitive verbs which

--- Page 4 ---



USER'S GUIDE xiv
eee

are also used reflexively. For such verbs the reflexive sense appears first, separated
from the transitive gloss by a semicolon.

For some transparent compound words no English gloss is given, but there is
cross reference to the constituent parts. In the case of some common derived forms,
there is also no gloss, but the reference section identifies what form it is. {Please
see the section under Reference below.)

SPANISH GLOSS

Following the English gloss and separated from it by a slash is the Spanish gloss.
By choice this is from Molina’s dictionary and is so identified by (M) after the gloss.
As an aid to the user, I have modernized Molina’s Spanish spelling. Molina has
separate entries for reflexive and transitive uses of verbs, with the reflexive preced-
ing any and all others and Jater glosses often referring back to the reflexive gloss. I
have followed the practice here, since it would be awkward to reorder them.

When a gloss from Molina is not available, I have chosen one from another
source or, in the few cases where no Spanish gloss has been available, I have writ-
ten one myself and indicated that I have done so with (K}. Please see the list of
abbreviations at the end of this guide for the other letters identifying sources.

ATTESTATIONS

Following the Spanish gloss there may be a list of attestations with the source
identified by initial and the location by folio or page number. If no attestations are
listed, the less-is-more principle is again at work; absence of such information
means that the word is widely and consistently attested across sources.

COMMENTARY

The commentary typically contains information about inconsistency in attesta-
tion, unexpected form or meaning, other words minimally contrasting in shape and
susceptible to confusion, etc. The commentary section also provides room for
substantial grammatical discussion where necessary and for comparison of literal
meaning with conventional usage in cases where the two are rather far apart.

Two symbols that appear in this section, always between two canonical forms,
may be unfamiliar: < means that the first form is derived from the second, while >
means that the first is the derivational source of the second.

REFERENCE

The references direct the user to other relevant entries in the dictionary. In the
case of a compound word, the component elements are given here; in the case of a

--- Page 5 ---



xv USER’S GUIDE

derived word, there is reference to the derivational source. In the case of applica-
tive, causative, and nonactive verb forms, the cross reference indicates which it is
and gives the basic verb from which it is formed. The reference section also identi-
fies the source of words in which the initial syllable has been reduplicated.

This dictionary is not intended to replace the great dictionaries of Molina and
Siméon. Molina’s dictionary has approximately 23,600 entries, while this one has
fewer than 9,000. The number of Molina’s entries is inflated by his practice of
making separate main entries of reflexive and transitive uses of verbs and of having
plural forms, insofar as he includes them, as main entries. On the other hand, this
dictionary includes relatively more applicative and nonactive verb forms.

But there are some simple, basic words that appear in Molina that are not at-
tested in any of the sources for this dictionary. One example is eptli ‘oyster’. About
this word we cannot know if the first vowel is long or short. Another omission is
tlalalacatl ‘goose’, in which any of the first three syllables might contain a short
vowel, a long vowel, or a short vowel and glottal stop. Because no source provides
us with information about these words, they do not appear in this dictionary.

On the other hand, many of the words Molina has that are missing from this
dictionary are compound or derived forms, and the component parts are indeed in
this dictionary. If the whole cannot be found here, the parts almost always can.

This dictionary is rigid in its exclusion of Spanish loanwords, more so than
Molina, who admitted several hundred, including cuentaxtli ‘rosary beads’ and
hicox ‘fig’ from Spanish cuenta and higo, respectively. The reason for the relentless
nativism of this dictionary is that loanwords exist in the language in all stages of
assimilation to the phonology of the language, as can be seen in the two examples
from Molina given here. As a result, it is rather meaningless to assign canonical
forms to them, existing as they do in transit from one language to the other.

To reiterate, this dictionary is not to displace Molina and Siméon. Its purpose is
to provide two things not to be found in those two dictionaries: {1) modern English
glosses and (2) information about long vowels and glottal stops in individual words.
Spanish-based orthography for Nahuatl obscured the second, and this dictionary—
the result of detailed comparative work—is a contribution to the renewed interest
in the actual phonology of the language behind the traditional orthographic repre-
sentation. If we are only in this decade returning to Horacio Carochi’s fold, still it
is better late than never.

If the user’s interest is only in glosses, the detailed commentary on phonology
and conflicting attestations may seem very tedious, and the fact that this diction-
ary is only a third as large as the previous ones may be a disappointment. I hope
that the analytical aspect of the dictionary, expressed both in the English glosses
and in the references between entries, will compensate. Let this dictionary join the
others as fellow and companion, a means to explication and clarification; it is not
intended as a competitor.

If it could be done without increasing the bulk of this volume, I would want to
print on every other page an exhortation to read the Introduction, which provides
further keys to understanding and using this work. Please read it and return to it
from time to time.

A

A preterit-as-present verb; pret: AC to be
present See AC.

AAQU(I] to be soaked / se empapa {Z}
[(3)JZp.49,139,181]. The literal sense of this
is ‘to water-enter.’ Z has the reflex of AH
instead of A-TL, but the sense is of A-TL,
and Z has AH for A-TL elsewhere. See
AQUII).

AC pl: AQUIHQUEH {one} who; who? /
¿quién? o ¿cuál? [M] This is the preterit
agentive form derived from the existential
verb A. It contrasts in vowel length with
AC, the preterit form of AQU(I] ‘to enter.’
See A, ACAH, AQUIN.

ACACHACHA-TL pI: -MEH a type of grass-
hopper, locust / otro género de Jangos-
tas (M] [(1)Tp.169]. See ACA-TL,
CHACHA-TL.

ACACHIQUIHU(I)-TL reed basket / canasto
hecho de cañas (M}, jicara para tortillas {X}
((3}Xp.25]. The initial vowel is not marked
long in the attestation. See ACA-TL,
CHIQUIHU(I)-TL.

ACACHTO first / primero, o primeramente
(M] See ACATTO, ACATTOPA, ACHTO.

ACAHUAL-LI large, dry leaves for lighting
ovens / yerbas secas y grandes para encen-
der hornos (Mi [(4JTp.169,170,243]. The
second vowel is attested long only once,
but it should be long if the literal sense
is ‘something dehydrated.’ See A-TL,
CAHU(ÍA).

ACAHUATOTO-TL small yellow or blue
bird with gray on the back / pájaro (chico,
amarillo o azul con gris sobre la espalda)

(T) [(3)Tp.170,243]. See ACAHUAL-LI,

The literal sense of this is ‘water-house.’
See Á-TL, CAL-LI.

ACALOAH a type of lizard that bites / un
animal que muerde—parecido a la largatija
(Z) [{1}Zp.139]. Z provides a picture which
appears to be of a gila monster. The final H
is uncharacteristic of native Nahuatl but is
common to vowel-final loanwords.

ACAMAPICH-TLI personal name
Acamapichtli [(2}Bf.8r,9v]. See ACA-TL,
MAPICH-TLI.

ACAMAYA crayfish, crab / langostino (Z}
{{2)Zp.25,139]. The attestation on Zp.139
has an uncharacteristic final H as does
ACALOAH.

ACAPAH-TLI medicinal plant with radish-
like leaves / planta medicinal semejante en
las hojas al rabano [{1)Rp.57]. The initial
vowel is not marked long in the attesta-
tion. See ACA-TL, PAH-TLI.

ACAPECH-TLI reed mat / petate de zacate
(Z) [{1)Zp.1 39}. Z fails to mark the initial
vowel long. See ACA-TL, PECH-TLI.

-TLAH.

ACHCA often / a menudo, frecuentemente
(C)

ACHCAMPA one knows not where / no sé
dénde (S) See ACH, -CAN, -PA.

ACHCANIN one knows not where / no sé
dónde (S) See ACH, CANIN.

ACHCAUH-TLI elder brother; leader of
youths / primogénito, hermano mayor de
alguien, el jefe de alguien (S] This seems to
be related to ACHTO ‘first,’ but there is a
vowel-length discrepancy. See ACH-TLI,
TACHCAUH, TIACHCAUH.

ACHCHICA often / a menudo, o frecuente-
mente {M} This is commonly written with
only a single CH. Of six attestations in C,
one has a marked long vowel in the second
syllable.

ACHCOL-LI great-grandfather, ancestor /
bisabuelo ¡M for achtontli, which is
in apposition with ACHCOL-LI in B}
((4)B£.6v,71,8x,11v, (3)Xp.32]. All the attes-
tations are possessed plurals with redupli-
cation of the COL element: COHCOL.
Two attestations have the first element
with a specifically marked short vowel,
two with a specifically marked long vowel.
In the paired form ACHTON-TLI, BE.6v,
the vowel of the first element is specifi-
cally marked short. This is inconsistent
with the first element of ACHCAUH-TLI
‘elder brother,’ which is without exception
marked long, but it agrees with ACHTO
‘first.’ X appears to have reanalyzed the
plural as a singular and dropped ACH. See
COL-LI.

ACHI a bit / un poco, o poca cosa, o
en alguna manera (M] This appears to
be an element in constructions where it
has the contrary sense of ‘a lot, more,
very much,’ as in ACHIPA ‘always,’
ACHICUAL-LI ‘better.’ See the note with
ACHIC. In some, but not all, construc-
tions this has a final glottal stop, ACHIH.
See ACHIHTETZIN, ACHIHTON,
ACHIHTZIN.

ACHIC just a short time / un poco de
tiempo {C} C marks the vowel of the
second syllable long in both this and the
comparative particle ACHIC. R marks it
long only in the comparative particle and
says they are distinct. See ACHI.

ACHIC particle used in making comparisons
/ hay diferencia entre una persona, o cosa,
y otra (C) This comparative ACHIC may be
related in some way to the contradictory
‘more’ sense of ACHI. See ACHI, IC.

ACHICA See ACHCHICA.

ACHICAHUAL-LI downpour / aguacero (X]
[(x}Xp.25]. See A-TL, CHICAHU(A).

ACHICAL-N pl: -TIN ~ -MEH nettle / ortiga

ACHIHUIA vrefí to wash one's hands while
grinding maize / se lava las manos (mujer

a glottal stop at the end of the stem, but in
general Nahuatl has -TL with this item.

ACHTLEIN See ACH, TLEIN.

ACH-TLI possessed form: -ACHYO seed /
pepita o semilla (C) ([(2)Cf.x26v, (2)Rp.58].
This seems to be related to XINÁCH-TLI
'seed,' but there is a vowel-length discrep-
ancy. It also seems to be related to the
HUACH element of AYOHHUACH-TLI
‘squash seed.’ It contrasts in vowel length
with ACH-TLI ‘elder brother.’

ACH-TLI elder brother (from the point of
view of a younger sister] / hermano mayor
de la hermana menor (€) [(1]Cf.126v,
(1]Rp.59]. This seems to be related to
